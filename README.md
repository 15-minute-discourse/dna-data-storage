DNA offers a compact, energy-efficient, and durable solution for this type of archival storage, potentially lasting for thousands, even millions, of years \[1, 2\].

● Historical Records and Cultural Heritage: DNA could revolutionize how we preserve valuable historical documents, artifacts, and cultural heritage \[2\]. Its longevity could ensure that future generations can access information about our past, even if current digital storage technologies become obsolete.

● Scientific Research Data: DNA can store vast amounts of research data generated by fields like genomics, astronomy, and climate science \[4\]. DNA-based storage systems could help manage these increasingly large datasets, facilitating scientific discoveries and collaborative research.

● Medical Records and Healthcare: DNA storage could provide secure, long-term backups for critical medical records \[4\]. This could ensure data integrity and availability, even in the event of cyberattacks or system failures. Researchers are also exploring the possibility of integrating DNA storage within medical devices or implants as a backup for personalized medical information \[4\].

● Securing Critical Information: The durability and high storage density of DNA make it appealing for securing vital information, ranging from government secrets to financial records \[5\]. DNA-based storage could offer a robust and tamper-proof solution for preserving data that needs to remain confidential and accessible for extended periods.

● DNA of Things (DoT): This emerging concept envisions integrating synthetic DNA into everyday objects to store information about their origin, manufacturing process, or other relevant data \[6\]. DoT could revolutionize product traceability, authentication, and even enable self-replicating objects. One researcher demonstrated DoT by 3D-printing a Stanford bunny containing its blueprint in the plastic filament, allowing future generations to extract the DNA and replicate the object \[6\].

● "Smart" Data Storage and Processing: Researchers are exploring the potential for combining DNA data storage with molecular computing \[7\]. This could lead to the development of "smart" data storage systems capable of performing computations directly within the DNA medium, reducing reliance on external processing.

● DNA Tagging and Authentication: DNA can serve as a unique identifier for tagging and authenticating valuable items like artwork, pharmaceuticals, or even minerals \[8, 9\]. DNA tagging offers a highly secure and virtually impossible-to-forge solution, combatting counterfeiting and illicit trade.

However, the widespread adoption of DNA data storage faces challenges, particularly the high cost of DNA synthesis and relatively slow read-write speeds \[2, 10\]. While the technology is advancing rapidly, these hurdles currently limit its use to specific applications.

As research and development continue, DNA data storage could transform how we preserve, manage, and utilize information in the future. Its remarkable properties offer a glimpse into a world where data can persist for millennia, securely archived and accessible for generations to come.

## DNA Data Storage: Security and Applications

Detecting data stored in DNA is not about casually examining everyday samples like spit on the ground. DNA data storage primarily focuses on encoding information within synthetic DNA sequences created in a controlled laboratory setting. The DNA used for this purpose is distinct from the DNA found in living organisms.

Here's why "spy-vs-spy" DNA data transfer through open-air fluids is unlikely:

● Encoding Complexity: The process of encoding digital data into DNA sequences involves sophisticated algorithms and laboratory procedures. It's not simply transferring existing biological DNA.

● Synthetic DNA: Researchers use synthesized DNA strands, created base by base, to store information \[1, 2\]. This is different from the DNA found in natural biological samples.

● Containment and Preservation: DNA data storage emphasizes the importance of protecting the synthesized DNA from degradation. This involves specialized containers and preservation methods, like encapsulation in silica, to ensure long-term stability and prevent contamination \[3-11\]. Researchers are investigating various materials and techniques to optimize DNA preservation, including storage at low temperatures and in inert atmospheres \[9, 10, 12, 13\].

● Targeted Retrieval: Data retrieval from DNA storage relies on specific techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. These methods require laboratory equipment and expertise \[14-19\].

Therefore, the DNA used for data storage is not meant to be casually spread or easily detected in the environment. It's contained within controlled systems designed for specific read-write operations.

While the idea of DNA data transfer in a spy scenario might sound intriguing, the current reality of DNA data storage is far more focused on secure, controlled, and specialized applications within laboratories and data centers.

The future of DNA data storage might involve more integrated systems, but it's unlikely to resemble the free exchange of biological fluids for covert communication. Instead, the focus remains on harnessing the potential of DNA for high-density, long-term, and secure data archiving \[20-31\].

## DNA Data Storage: A Comprehensive Overview

DNA data storage is a new method of storing digital information using synthesized DNA. DNA is a very stable molecule that can store information for thousands of years, and it has the potential to offer a much higher storage density than traditional storage methods \[1-6\].

The process of DNA data storage involves several steps:

● Encoding: Digital information, in the form of binary data (0s and 1s), is converted into the four-letter code of DNA, represented by the nucleotide bases adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G) \[5, 7, 8\]. This conversion involves sophisticated algorithms that map binary data to DNA sequences \[7, 8\].

● Synthesis: The encoded DNA sequences are then synthesized into physical DNA molecules \[9\]. Current DNA synthesis technology allows for the creation of short DNA strands, typically less than 200 nucleotides long \[10-13\].

● Storage: The synthesized DNA molecules can be stored in various forms, such as in a solution, dried down, or encapsulated in silica for added protection \[11, 14, 15\]. These storage methods can ensure the long-term stability of the DNA molecules, protecting them from degradation \[11, 14, 15\].

● Retrieval: When the stored data is needed, the DNA molecules are retrieved and amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) \[7, 11, 16\]. PCR is a technique that allows for the replication of specific DNA sequences, enabling researchers to obtain a larger quantity of the desired DNA \[7, 11, 16\].

● Sequencing: The amplified DNA molecules are then sequenced to determine the order of the nucleotide bases \[17, 18\]. DNA sequencing technology has advanced significantly in recent years, allowing for faster and more accurate reading of DNA sequences \[12\].

● Decoding: Finally, the sequenced DNA data is decoded back into the original binary data, using the same algorithms used in the encoding process \[9, 19\]. Decoding algorithms take into account the possibility of errors during storage and retrieval to ensure the accurate recovery of the data \[9, 19\].

Advantages of DNA data storage:

● High storage density: DNA has the potential to store information at a density far exceeding that of traditional storage media. A single gram of DNA could theoretically hold as much data as millions of CDs \[5, 8, 20-22\].
